# Vitamin C for Java
Compile and run java source codes in one go.
This is only good if you're running Java codes from the command prompt.

### Name of the Program
Don't take it too seriously :)

### Usage
Just type in your source code filename __with the extension__

### Mechanism
All this does is just issue cmd commands for "javac" and "java", all you need to do is to input your java file (one at a time).

The dashed lines indicate both the beginning and the end of the program being run

### Issues
1. The java program will still be run even if there are errors with it. What you can do is to first check for the error messages. If there are error messages then disregard the execution part (indicated with the dashed lines) as that might be the previous compiled java program being run.
2. The executable file might take some time to startup, so don't worry if you see a blank screen. There will be text appearing in the program to prompt for the filename

### Notes
1. This program is not really complete, feel free to modify it and make it better :)
